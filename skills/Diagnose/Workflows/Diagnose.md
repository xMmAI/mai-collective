# Diagnose — 6-Phase Debugging Workflow

A discipline for hard bugs. **Skip phases only when explicitly justified.**

---

## Phase 1 — Build a Feedback Loop

**This is the skill. Everything else is mechanical.**

If you have a fast, deterministic, agent-runnable pass/fail signal for the bug, you will find the cause. Bisection, hypothesis-testing, and instrumentation all just consume that signal. If you don't have one, no amount of staring at code will help.

**Spend disproportionate effort here. Be aggressive. Be creative. Refuse to give up.**

### Ways to construct a loop — try in roughly this order

1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug — unit, integration, e2e.
2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright) — drives the UI, asserts on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace** — save a real network request/payload/event log to disk, replay through the code path in isolation.
6. **Throwaway harness** — spin up a minimal subset of the system (one service, mocked deps) that exercises the bug code path with a single function call.
7. **Property / fuzz loop** — if the bug is "sometimes wrong output", run 1000 random inputs and look for the failure mode.
8. **Bisection harness** — if the bug appeared between two known states (commit, dataset, version), automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so you can `git bisect run` it.
9. **Differential loop** — run the same input through old-version vs new-version (or two configs) and diff outputs.
10. **HITL (human-in-the-loop) script** — last resort only. If a human must click, write a structured script that tells them exactly what to do step-by-step and captures their observations. The loop is still structured even if a human runs it.

### Iterate on the loop itself

Treat the loop as a product. Once you have *a* loop, ask:

- Can I make it faster? (Cache setup, skip unrelated init, narrow the test scope.)
- Can I make the signal sharper? (Assert on the specific symptom, not "didn't crash".)
- Can I make it more deterministic? (Pin time, seed RNG, isolate filesystem, freeze network.)

A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than no loop. A 2-second deterministic loop is a debugging superpower.

### Non-deterministic bugs

The goal is not a clean repro but a **higher reproduction rate**. Loop the trigger 100×, parallelise, add stress, narrow timing windows, inject sleeps. A 50%-flake bug is debuggable; 1% is not — keep raising the rate until it's debuggable.

### When you genuinely cannot build a loop

Stop and say so explicitly. List what you tried. Ask for:
- (a) Access to whatever environment reproduces it
- (b) A captured artifact (HAR file, log dump, screen recording with timestamps)
- (c) Permission to add temporary instrumentation

**Do not proceed to Phase 2 without a loop you believe in.**

---

## Phase 2 — Reproduce

Run the loop. Watch the bug appear.

Confirm before moving on:

- [ ] The loop produces the failure the **user** described — not a different nearby failure. Wrong bug = wrong fix.
- [ ] The failure is reproducible across multiple runs (or, for non-deterministic bugs, at a high enough rate to debug against).
- [ ] You have captured the exact symptom (error message, wrong output, slow timing) so later phases can verify the fix addresses *this* specific issue.

**Do not proceed until you reproduce the bug.**

---

## Phase 3 — Hypothesise

Generate **3–5 ranked hypotheses** before testing any of them. Single-hypothesis generation anchors on the first plausible idea.

Each hypothesis must be **falsifiable** — state the prediction it makes:

> "If **[X]** is the cause, then **[changing Y]** will make the bug disappear / **[changing Z]** will make it worse."

If you cannot state a prediction, the hypothesis is a guess — discard it or sharpen it until it becomes testable.

**Show the ranked list to the user before testing.** They often have domain knowledge that re-ranks instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3"), or know hypotheses already ruled out. Cheap checkpoint, big time saver. Don't block on it — proceed with your ranking if they're AFK.

---

## Phase 4 — Instrument

Each probe must map to a specific prediction from Phase 3. **Change one variable at a time.**

**Tool preference (in order):**
1. **Debugger / REPL inspection** if the environment supports it — one breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. **Targeted logs** at the boundaries that distinguish hypotheses.
3. Never "log everything and grep" — it creates noise and doesn't test predictions.

**Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix, e.g. `[DEBUG-a4f2]`. Cleanup at the end becomes a single grep. Untagged logs survive accidentally; tagged logs die cleanly.

**Performance branch:** For performance regressions, logs are usually wrong. Instead: establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, `performance.now()`, profiler, query plan), then bisect the change history. Measure first, hypothesise second, fix third.

---

## Phase 5 — Fix + Regression Test

Write the regression test **before the fix** — but only if there is a **correct seam** for it.

A correct seam is one where the test exercises the **real bug pattern** at the actual call site. If the only available seam is too shallow (a unit test that can't replicate the chain that triggered the bug), a regression test there gives false confidence.

**If no correct seam exists, that itself is a finding.** Note it. The architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down.

If a correct seam exists:

1. Turn the minimised repro into a failing test at that seam.
2. Watch it fail (RED).
3. Apply the fix.
4. Watch it pass (GREEN).
5. Re-run the Phase 1 feedback loop against the original (un-minimised) scenario.

---

## Phase 6 — Cleanup + Post-Mortem

Required before declaring done:

- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces — re-run the Phase 1 loop
- [ ] Regression test passes, or absence of correct seam is documented
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` instrumentation removed — `grep -r "DEBUG-" .` to confirm
- [ ] Throwaway harnesses and prototype files deleted
- [ ] The hypothesis that turned out correct is stated in the commit message — so the next person learns

**Then ask: what would have prevented this bug?**

If the answer involves an architectural issue (no good test seam, tangled callers, hidden coupling), make a note of it for a future architecture review. Do this *after* the fix is in — you have more information now than when you started.
